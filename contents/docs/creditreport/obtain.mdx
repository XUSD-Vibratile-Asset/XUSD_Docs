You may purchase vour VibePass on the ##associated website.##
The price of the VibePass is ##250,000 1SWAP tokens## and will be tied to a linear scale, which decreases the price of a VibePass ##over time.##

## **What are the benefits of owning a VibePass?**

First off, **everyone** starts with ##450 Good Vibes.##

Owning a VibePass early such as XUSD Genesis lets you in on the benefits of Vibes ##straight away## because you will start earning those extra Vibes rather than later so that when peg is reached, your rewards will be ##exponentially increased.##

##The Scale:## ##There will be a linear scale pegged to the price of a VibePass##, so if you can not afford a VibePass now, do not worry. But, purchasing one now will open you up to ##more benefits than other users.##
So, the choice is yours, and this is where scalability plays a vital role. 

##Personal Team Opinion:## We highly recommend you get a VibePass now than later. A VibePass is ##your key to financial freedom, your key to frictionless and absolute decentralised banking.##

##How we envision the VibePass to HEX:## Think of the VibePass like a HEX T-share, the goal is to ##get as many shares as early as possible## to have ##more benefits later## such as ##higher-yielding rewards.##
So, in comparison with T-shares and HEX that is time locked, ##XUSD pays out its native token to its VibePass holders when reaching the peg.##

## **How many VibePasses can a wallet own?**

You may only hold ##ONE## VibePass per wallet. For the Whales in our ecosystem, if you want to have ##MORE THAN ONE## VibePass for ##more yield and Voting power##, you will therefore obviously need ##multiple wallets.##
