You may purchase your VibePass on the **associated website.**
The price of the VibePass is **250,000 1SWAP tokens.**

## **What are the benefits of owning a VibePass?**

First off, everyone starts with 450 Good Vibes.

Owning a VibePass early such as the XUSD Genesis lets you in on the benefits of Good Vibes straight away. This is because you will start earning those extra Vibes now, rather than later. So, that means when the peg is reached, your rewards will be exponentially increased.

## **The Scale:** 

There will be a linear scale pegged to the price of a VibePass. So, if you can not afford a VibePass now, do not worry. But, purchasing one now will open you up to more benefits than other users.
So, the choice is yours, and this is where scalability plays a vital role.

## **Personal Team Opinion:**

We highly recommend you get a VibePass now than later. A VibePass is your key to financial freedom, where scalability meets an investors demands. A key to frictionless and absolute decentralised banking.

## **How we envision the VibePass to HEX:** 

Think of the VibePass like a HEX T-share, the goal is to get as many shares as early as possible to have more benefits later such as higher-yielding rewards.
So, in comparison with T-shares and HEX that is time locked, XUSD pays out its native token to its VibePass holders only when reaching the peg, which negates all possible chances of a harsh sell-off.

### Delayed Gratification is cool, right? we know.

This is going to be absolutely revolutionary. We personally believe the XUSD Vibratile Asset is what will help spark the long-awaited bull cycle for PulseChain because it brings every community together. 
It penalises Bad Actors and only promotes Good Actors as well as a very healthy market overall.

## **How many VibePasses can a wallet own?**

You may only hold one VibePass per wallet. For the Whales in our ecosystem, if you want to have more than one VibePass for more yield and Voting power, you will therefore obviously need multiple wallets.
