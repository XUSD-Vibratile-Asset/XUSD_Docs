The LitPass is your passport and identification for accessing higher levels within the Vibratile token protocol. Owning a LitPass sets you apart from general users, providing exclusive benefits and enhanced participation in the ecosystem.

## Benefits of LitPass
### Seigniorage:

**Definition:** Seigniorage refers to the profit made from issuing currency, particularly the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce it.   
**Function:** Once the token price is above the peg, inflation occurs to bring the price back down. The resulting seigniorage is distributed to LitPass holders in proportion to the amount of XUSD they have burned.   
**Benefit:** This mechanism rewards active participants who contribute to the stability of the token by burning XUSD.   

### Voting Power:

**Requirement:** Ownership of a LitPass is mandatory for participating in the Community Accountability Governance (CAG).  
**Function:** LitPass holders can vote on vibe classes, protocol changes, and other important decisions within the ecosystem.   
**Benefit:** This ensures that only committed and vested members influence the protocol's direction, promoting a more engaged and responsible community.   

### User Rankings:

### Social Status: 

The LitPass is a key to different user rankings within the ecosystem, determining access to various features and privileges.  
**Access:** Higher-ranked users may have access to exclusive benefits, good vibes, and more influential voting power.   
**Benefit:** This hierarchical structure incentivizes users to engage positively with the protocol, contributing to its stability and growth.   
### Secure Protocol Communication:

**Encryption:** LitPass enables encrypted communication between the protocol and users, ensuring secure transmission of important votes and community messages.
