description: XUSD Access Control 
---

We have an access control system in place, which is on the contract level. This system grants users permissions, which allows them to use additional functions. 
While the first levels are relatively easy to obtain, the more higher ones are more team-based with permissions that are generally moreover security-based. 

  ```solidity {7} showLineNumbers
    enum Rank {
        PRINCEPS,         // 0
        GLADIATOR,        // 1
        LEGATUS,          // 2
        SENATOR,          // 3
        CONSUL,           // 4
        PRAETORMAXIMUS    // 5 (Highest rank)
    }
````
## PRINCEPS
The PRINCEPS are the Base-level where every user starts.
## GLADIATOR
The GLADIATOR is the rank most users will find themselves in. It is necessary to have this rank to purchase a VibePass, and really, it is there to show more of the general activity. To achieve this rank, you will need a Good Vibe of 450. 
## LEGATUS
This LEGATUS is reserved for community leaders. You must already be a community leader at the time of Genesis, and we will manually asign you to this rank. There is however, a way to obtain this with your on-chain data. 
This rank will give you more control on the contracts. This is a trusted position, so it is encouraged to hold them accountable. During Genesis, they will hold the ability to add LP tokens to the list of rewarded LP trades. 
## SENATOR
The SENATOR will be the highest position obtainable. You also must be elected to this position. Users who are SENATOR will have the delegated ability to make swift changes such as including the ability to enable, or disable Vibes without the need for a vote. They will need however need at least 2 or 3 SENATOR signatures for the change to be accepted through the MultiSig voting system. This rank will most likely come into existence near the end of Bootstrapping. 
## CONSUL 
The CONSUL rank is reserved for the contracts in the system.   
## PRAETORMAXIMUS
The PRAETORMAXIMUS is the Dev MultiSig deployer wallet. This role is in no way, meant to be a supreme controller. This is more for a developmental-type access to contracts. Once Bootstrapping is over, we will have the ability to revoke these permissions.
It is more here for setup, and for safety. All while the protocol is still new. 


## Vibe Votes
Each rank will have a different weight when it comes to voting. This is to keep in-line with a DeFi Republic. As we get larger, it is more important and appropriate to delegate our votes to elected officials, so we can mimic that here with the rank weights.
PRINCEPS = 0
GLADIATOR = 1
LEGATUS = 2
SENATOR = 3
PRAETORMAXIMUS = 5 (Highest rank)

Even though the higest ranks can just make the Vibe happen, it is not encouraged to do so. Those are for times of emergency.
You can gain these ranks, but you will still need a VibePass to vote, and collect on siegniorage.
