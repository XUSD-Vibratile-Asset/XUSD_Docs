description:  XUSD Access Control 
---

We have an acceess control system in place on the contract level granting users permisions to use additional functions. While the first levels are relatively easy to obtain the more higher ones are more team based with permistions that are more security based. 

  ```solidity {7} showLineNumbers
    enum Rank {
        PRINCEPS,         // 0
        GLADIATOR,        // 1
        LEGATUS,          // 2
        SENATOR,          // 3
        CONSUL,           // 4
        PREATORMAXIMUS    // 5 (Highest rank)
    }
````
## PRINCEPS
Base level user everyone starts here.
## GLADIATOR
This is the level that most will find themselves in. It is necessary to have this rank to purchase a vibe pass and really is there to show more of general activity. To achieve this rank you will need a Vibe of 800 or less. 
## LEGATUS
This rank is reserved for community leaders. You must already be a community leader at time of genesis and we will manually add you. There is a way to obtain this with your on chain data. 
This rank will give you more control on the contracts. This is a trusted position so it is encouraged to hold them accountable. Durring genesis they will hold the ability to add LP tokens to the list of Rewarded LP trades. 
## SENATOR
This will be the highest position obtainable. You also must be elected to this position. Users who are SENATOR will have the delegated ability to make swift changes. Including the ability to enable or disable vibes without the need for a vote. They will need 
at least 2 or 3  SENATOR signatures for it to go through. This rank will come along probably near the end of bootstrapping. 
## CONSUL 
This rank is reserved for the contracts in the system.   
## PREATORMAXIMUS
This is the Dev Multisig deployer wallet. This role is in no way ment to be a supreme controler, this is more for a developmental access to contracts. Once bootstrapping is over we will have the abilitie to revoke these permitions.
Its more here for setup and for saftey while the protocol is still new. 


## Vibe Votes
Each rank will have a different weight when it comes to voting. This is to keep in line with a republic. As we get larger it is better to delegate our votes to elected officials so we mimic that here with the rank weights.
PRINCEPS = 0
GLADIATOR = 1
LEGATUS = 2
SENATOR = 3
PREATORMAXIMUS = 5 

Even tho the higest ranks can just make the vibe happen, it is not encouraged to do so, those are for times of emergency.
You can gain these ranks but still need a Vibepass to vote and collect on siegniorage.
