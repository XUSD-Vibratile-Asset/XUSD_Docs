**Description:** *Vibe Votes and Assigned Ranks in the XUSD Ecosystem*

In the XUSD Vibratile Asset ecosystem, different ranks carry varying voting powers. This system ensures that governance aligns with the principles of a decentralized finance (DeFi) republic. As the community grows, delegating votes to elected officials becomes increasingly important. The rank system allows for a balance of power through weight-based voting. Below are the details of each rank:

---

## üéñÔ∏è Ranks Overview

### üëë PRINCEPS

The **PRINCEPS** rank is where every user starts. This base-level rank marks the beginning of a user‚Äôs journey within the XUSD ecosystem.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è GLADIATOR

The **GLADIATOR** rank represents the majority of active users. To purchase a **VibePass** and engage in more advanced ecosystem activities, users must reach this rank. Achieving the **GLADIATOR** rank requires a **Good Vibe score of 450**.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è LEGATUS

The **LEGATUS** rank is reserved for community leaders. These individuals must already hold leadership positions at the time of Genesis and are manually assigned this rank. However, it is possible to achieve **LEGATUS** status based on your on-chain data.

- **Special Permissions**: Holders of this rank have greater control over contracts and the ability to add LP tokens to the list of rewarded LP trades. This is a trusted position, and **accountability** is important.

---

### üèõÔ∏è SENATOR

The **SENATOR** is the highest rank obtainable by election. **SENATORS** have delegated authority to make important changes, such as enabling or disabling Vibes, without requiring a general vote.

- **MultiSig Requirement**: Changes made by **SENATORS** require **2 or 3 signatures** from other SENATORS for approval through the MultiSig voting system.
- This rank is expected to come into effect near the end of the Bootstrapping phase.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è CONSUL

The **CONSUL** rank holds control over all contracts within the XUSD Vibratile Asset ecosystem.

---

### üîë PRAETORMAXIMUS

The **PRAETORMAXIMUS** rank belongs to the **Dev MultiSig deployer wallet**. This rank is not meant to act as a supreme controller but is focused on development and access to contracts during the initial phases of the protocol.

- Once the Bootstrapping phase concludes, the permissions of the **PRAETORMAXIMUS** rank can be revoked, ensuring safety during the early stages of the protocol‚Äôs development.

---

## üîê XUSD Access Control System (ACS)

The **Access Control System (ACS)** governs permissions within the XUSD contracts. This system grants certain privileges to users, allowing them to perform additional functions based on their rank. While the lower ranks are easily accessible, the higher ranks come with more responsibilities and security-based permissions.

- **Emergency Use**: Although the highest ranks have the power to trigger a Vibe, such actions are reserved for emergencies and should not be used lightly.
- **VibePass Requirement**: Regardless of rank, users need a **VibePass** to vote and collect seigniorage.

The ranks and permissions follow the structure below:

```solidity
enum Rank {
    PRINCEPS,         // 0
    GLADIATOR,        // 1
    LEGATUS,          // 2
    SENATOR,          // 3
    CONSUL,           // 4
    PRAETORMAXIMUS    // 5 (Highest rank)
}
