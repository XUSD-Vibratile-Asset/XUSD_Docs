description:  Maintaining Stability After Reaching Peg

The journey to regaining our peg will be challenging but immensely rewarding. Once we achieve it, there will be a cause for celebration—like a giant party. But then, what comes next?

## Healty peg maintenence
Unlike many other tokens that rely on collateral backing to maintain their peg, our approach is different. This distinction is what gives rise to the term "Volatilate." When our token is above peg, those holding the LitPass will receive a share of freshly minted tokens. So not only will you have already gained significantly, but you’re also poised to continue earning more over time.

## Seigniorage
Seigniorage refers to the profit made from issuing currency, specifically the difference between the cost of creating the currency and its market value. The rate of expansion—how many tokens are minted—is crucial for maintaining a healthy peg. Over-minting can destabilize the peg, while under-minting could stifle growth.

At this moment, we don’t have a precise formula to determine the optimal expansion rate, but we are committed to developing this over the coming months. Here’s an overview of the process:

At the end of an epoch (approximately every 6 to 12 hours), if we are still above peg, new tokens will be minted and distributed to LitPass holders.
These tokens can be claimed immediately or stored within the LitPass until needed.
Given the growth of our economy, there shouldn't be an immediate need to sell off these tokens. We plan to set up an isolated lending market, ideally with the new Impermax, along with a range of innovative products that will soon become available.
