description:  Maintaining Stability After Reaching Peg

Navigating the intricate process of restoring and sustaining our peg will undoubtedly present various challenges; however, the rewards associated with this endeavor are immense. Upon successfully attaining our peg, it will warrant a significant celebration, akin to a grand festivity. However, the pressing question remains: what steps should we take following this achievement?
## Healty peg maintenence
In contrast to numerous other tokens that depend on collateralization to uphold their peg, our methodology is fundamentally distinct, giving rise to the concept of "Volatilate." When our token's valuation exceeds the peg, holders of the LitPass will be entitled to receive a proportion of newly minted tokens. Consequently, not only will these holders enjoy substantial gains from their initial investment, but they will also be positioned to accumulate further earnings over time.

## Seigniorage
Seigniorage pertains to the profits generated from the issuance of currency, specifically defined as the disparity between the costs incurred in producing the currency and its market valuation. The rate of expansion—essentially, the quantity of tokens minted—is pivotal to sustaining a stable peg. Excessive minting can lead to destabilization of the peg, while insufficient minting may hinder potential growth.


Currently, we do not possess a definitive formula to ascertain the optimal rate of expansion; nevertheless, we are dedicated to refining this model in the months ahead. The following outlines our operational process:

At the conclusion of each epoch (approximately every 6 to 12 hours), should our valuation remain above the peg, new tokens will be minted and subsequently distributed to LitPass holders. These tokens can be claimed immediately or stored within the LitPass for future use. Given the anticipated expansion of our economic ecosystem, there is unlikely to be an immediate necessity to liquidate these tokens. We intend to establish a dedicated lending market, ideally utilizing the new Impermax platform, alongside an array of innovative products set to become available soon.
