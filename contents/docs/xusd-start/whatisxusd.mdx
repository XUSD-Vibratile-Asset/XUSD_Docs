title: XUSD is Vibratile
description: 
---



 **Vibratile**:   capable of or characterized by oscillatory motion.


A Vibratile token is a digital asset characterized by its oscillatory motion around a fixed point, designed to fluctuate above and below a target price. Unlike stablecoins, which maintain a steady value, Vibratile tokens embrace volatility to achieve their price stability. For instance, the token XUSD oscillates around the price of 1 USD but should not be mistaken for a stablecoin.


### Conceptual Analogy

>Imagine a loose, dangling rope bridge you need to tighten to cross. To tighten it, you cut and shorten the rope, raising the bridge. If it becomes too high, you add more rope to lower it. Similarly, XUSD contracts its supply by burning tokens on every transaction, much like shortening the rope to raise the price. When the price is too high, it inflates the supply to bring it back down.

### Differences from Stablecoins

Unlike stablecoins, which rely on collateral to maintain their value, Vibratile tokens like XUSD maintain their price through token mechanics and the strength of the community. A stablecoin's value is directly tied to a reserve asset (e.g., USDC has a 1:1 backing with USD). In contrast, Vibratile tokens maintain there peg via algorythims and mechanics that support both contraction and inflation of the supply.

## Mechanisms of XUSD

### Contraction
Contraction refers to the shortening of the token supply, opposite of inflation. XUSD contracts its supply through a burning mechanism, where tokens are taken out of circulation. The primary contractionary mechanism for XUSD is the Vibratile Credits, with 70% of all vibe credits burned and the rest used for credit bonds. This ensures a continuous contractionary burn, increasing with transaction volume. Additional contraction methods can be implemented, with users credited for their contributions to burning tokens.

### Inflation 
XUSD is designed to burn tokens on every transaction, eventually reducing the supply to a level where demand exceeds the target price. When demand surpasses supply, inflation is necessary to bring the price back to the target level. Unlike traditional negative connotations of inflation, in the context of XUSD, inflation is a tool for economic growth and maintaining price stability. Inflationary rewards are distributed to key stakeholders (kings), who then use them to adjust the price of XUSD.

The rate of inflation for XUSD is determined based on a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and an epoch time period. Adjustments are made as necessary to align inflation with economic growth.



### Importance of Community Trust
The value of Vibratile tokens are inherently tied to the trust and perceived value within the community. Understanding the importance of this trust will be discussed in further sections, highlighting its role in the stability and growth of Vibratile tokens like XUSD.

### Next Steps
In the upcoming brainstorming section, we will explore various theoretical ways users can contribute to the contraction of XUSD while also increasing their earnings.
