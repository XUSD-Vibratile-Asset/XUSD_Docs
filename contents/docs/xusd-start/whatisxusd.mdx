title: XUSD is Vibratile!

 **Vibratile**:   capable of or characterized by oscillatory motion.


A Vibratile token is a digital asset designed to oscillate around a fixed point. Unlike stablecoins, which aim to maintain a steady value, Vibratile tokens fluctuate above and below a target price. For instance, the token XUSD oscillates around the price of 1 USD. It's crucial to note that XUSD is not a stablecoin and should not be treated as one.



> Imagine a loose, dangling rope bridge you need to tighten to cross. To tighten it, you cut and shorten the rope, raising the bridge. If it becomes too high, you add more rope to lower it. Similarly, XUSD contracts its supply by burning tokens on every transaction, just like shortening the length of the rope, it tightening up the supply to raise the price. When it is to high it will inflate the supply to bring it back down.

I wont go into how a stablecoin works but think of it like this. I go to circle and buy USDC with cash for 1 to 1. For every USDC there is 1 USD so thats what it is worth. 
A vibratile token does not or does not rely on colladeral to achieve its goal. XUSD maintains its price through token mechanics and the strength of the community.
I also dont mean who will catch the falling knife, everything is valued based on a communities trust 
and agreed precieved value. Later we will discuss why this is incredably importaint but lets continue on with how. 

### Contraction

Contraction is the shortening of the tokens supply. Opposite of inflation. This happens when the XUSD is burned, or taken out of circulation. **Burning LP tokens containing XUSD does not take tokens out of circulation.**
The main contractionary mechanic that XUSD has is the Dynamic Taxes. 70% of all taxes are burned and the rest used for bonds. 
This means that there will always be some kind of contractionary burn going on. The more users are transacting the more it will burn. 
Now it is still **Highly Encouraged** to create ways that burn the token as well. Users interacting with your contract that subsiquentally calls the burn function will be credited those burn numbers. 
Later on in the brainstorming section we will discuss a number of theoretical ways users can contribute to the contraction of XUSD while also increasing there earnings along the way.

### Inflation 

XUSD is designed to be burn on every transaction. This means that eventually as the token is being used, the supply will be small enough so that the current demand of the token is 
enough to surpass that of the targeted price. This means that the demand of the token has far exceeded the current supply circulating. Inflation usually incurres a negative meaning,
the cost of everything is up and the "crash" of the economy, you know what I mean. Heres the thing, we have to inflate the supply to get the price back down to the target level. The kings will recieve this inflationary rewards
and spend it bringing the total price of XUSD back down or below our target level. This is not a bad thing. Inflation is neccesary for economic growth and also allows for discounts. **The rate at witch XUSD will inflate has not yet been determined.**
It will however be based on a TWAP price and an EPOC time period. We take this part seriously as it is importaint to get the size of inflation right with the growth of the economy. This will be updated when neccesary.
