## Genesis Trading - 7/8 of XUSD Disbursment 

We need fellow community leaders to step forward to participate and get a rank up by submitting a community wallet. The wallet will have access to whitelist LP tokens that they create with XUSD. Traders trading on those whitelisted pairs will then be able to recieve XUSD rewards if they have a good enough Vibe.
You can also obtain the rank to list LP tokens yourself, you just need a vibe of 300 or less. 

## How Genesis Trading Works

So we have a XUSD and it is paired with SIMP for example. Any trades betweed the XUSD and SIMP via that LP token will be eligable to recieve rewards. Those rewards will be sent to your wallet in the same transaction. However, you must also have a vibe score of 450 to get the rewards!
To make things easier, you can get a 50 good vibe bonus for staking in the genesis pool. So if you are staked in genesis then you will be eligable to recieve the trading rewards. If you unstake you will lose that 50. 

## Daily Rewards Limit

if you qualify and are trading on the correct pair, that the reward amount you will get per trade will be dependent on the size of the trade. You will get approxametly 1/4 of the amount you have just traded. There is also a daily max of 1000 per user per day, as well as a total daily limit of 30K per day.
There is also a small minimum you must deposit in order for your good vibes to count when staking in genesis.
