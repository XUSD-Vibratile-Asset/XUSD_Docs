## Genesis Trading - 7/8 of XUSD Disbursement 

We need help from fellow community leaders to step forward, and to participate. It is vital they attain a rank-up by submitting a Community Wallet. This Community Wallet will have access to whitelisting LP tokens that they create with XUSD. Traders transacting on those whitelisted pairs will then be able to recieve XUSD rewards IF they have a good enough Vibe.
You can also obtain the rank to list LP tokens yourself, you just need a Vibe Ranking of 300 or less. 

## How Genesis Trading Works

## Example: We have a XUSD, and it is paired with SIMP for example. Any trades between the XUSD and SIMP via that LP token will be eligible to receive rewards. Those rewards will be sent to your wallet in the same transaction. However, you must also have a Vibe Score of 450 to get the rewards!
To make things easier, you can get a 50 Good Vibe bonus for staking in the Genesis Pool. So, if you are staked in Genesis, then you will be eligible to receive the trading rewards. If you unstake, you will lose that 50 Good Vibe bonus. 

## Daily Rewards Limit

if you qualify, and are trading on the correct pair, the reward amount you will get per trade will be dependant on the size of the trade. You will get approximatly 1/4 of the amount you have just traded. There is also a daily max of 1,000 XUSD per user per day, as well as a total daily limit of 30,000 XUSD per day.
There is also a small minimum you must deposit in order for your Good Vibes to count when staking in Genesis.
