## Notifications and Safety

Managing safety within the protocol is crucial, and automating alerts via Telegram is one of the most effective methods. These bots are designed to notify you immediately whenever an on-chain event occurs, providing real-time updates. Additionally, they are incredibly useful for monitoring the voting and governance aspects of the protocol, keeping you informed and engaged.

## Treasury Bot

The Treasury Bot sends notifications for every transaction made by the Treasury's MultiSig Address. Transparency is paramount. This bot ensures you stay informed about all activities, including the launch of new contracts.

## Community Accountability Governance Bot (CAG)

The Community Accountability Governance Bot allows you to stay up-to-date. This bot alerts you whenever a new class of a Vibe Credit proposal is submitted. It also notifies you when a proposal is approved and subsequently activated.

## XUSD Supply and Price Bot

The XUSD Supply and Price Bot is used to call, and view the current status of the supply as well as the price of the token.

## VibePass Bot

The VibePass Bot helps you track your rank, and status within the community. It's a great tool to see how much you have contributed to the burn, as well as your overall position within the community.

## Important Voting Verdict

**(this will come into play somewhere in the forseeable future, specifically under the power of the SENATOR rank)**

The Important Voting Verdict Bot alerts the community when either a Good, or Bad Actor has been manually flagged by the system.
This bot will act as a portal, so that if a user has either contributed towards the protocol, helped out in some benevolent way or a user is known to create rugpulls. This is so that other users can flag those Actors in the system for future reference.
