## Notifications and Safety

Managing safety within the protocol is crucial, and automating alerts via Telegram is one of the most effective methods. These bots are designed to notify you immediately whenever an on-chain event occurs, providing real-time updates. Additionally, they are incredibly useful for monitoring the voting and governance aspects of the protocol, keeping you informed and engaged.

## Treasury Bot

The Treasury Bot sends notifications for every transaction made by the Treasury's Multisig Address. Transparency is paramount, and this bot ensures you stay informed about all activities, including the launch of new contracts.

## Community Accountability Governance (CAG) Bot

Stay up-to-date with the Community Accountability Governance Bot, which alerts you whenever a new class Vibe Credit proposal is submitted. It also notifies you when a proposal is approved and subsequently activated.

## XUSD Supply and Price Bot

This one is used to call and view the current status of the supply and the price of the token.

## VibePass Bot

The VibePass Bot helps you track your rank and status within the community. It's a great tool to see how much you've contributed to the burn and your overall position in the community.

## Important Voting Verdict

The Important Voting Verdict Bot alerts the community when either a Good or Bad Actor has been manually flagged by the system.
So, this is either if a user has contributed towards the protocol or helped out in some benevolent way, or a user is known to create rugpulls.
