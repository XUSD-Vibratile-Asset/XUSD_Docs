---

**Definition:**
Basis Points (bps) are a unit of measure used in finance to describe percentage changes or rate changes. One Basis Point is equal to 0.01%. In the context of Vibratile Credits, Basis Points are used to determine the Vibe Credit each Vibe Class.

## Vibe Credit Calculation Using Basis Points
**Vibe Class Basis Points:**
Every Vibe Class in the system uses Basis Points to determine the Vibratile Credit. These Basis Points are easily retrievable on each individual contract to avoid confusion, or misplacement.

**Good Vibes and Bad Vibes:**

**Good Vibes:** These decrease the Vibratile Credit Rate for the user. They act as incentives or rewards for positive behavior or contributions to the ecosystem.
**Bad Vibes:** These increase the Vibratile Credit Rate for the user, penalizing negative behavior or actions that harm the community.


**Vibe Distribution**
**Burning Mechanism:**

**70% of All Vibe Credits are Burned:** Currently, 70% of all collected Vibe Credits are burned in the same transaction in-which they were collected. This immediate reduction in the token supply helps to maintain the price stability of Vibratile tokens like XUSD.
**30% for Collateralized Debt Positions:** The remaining 30% of collected Vibe Credits are stored and used for overcollateralized debt positions. These funds act as a financial buffer, and can be adjusted as needed. This allocation might be subject to change, with a potential shift towards even more burning to further stabilize the token price.
