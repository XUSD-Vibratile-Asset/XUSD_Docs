## Good Vibes and Bad Vibes

### What is my vibe?
Your Vibratile Credit is determined by the Vibe Classes in the protocol, that calculates your Vibe. The community will vote on the Vibe Classes. These votes will determin if you are getting Good Vibes, or Bad Vibes.

### Developer Role, Community Voting And Developer's Responsibility:

**Vibe Logic Creation:** Developers design the Vibe Logic, deciding who, and how you get Vibes. Developers can create complex, or simple Vibe Credit mechanisms, which are tailored to different scenarios.  
**Integration Testing:** All Vibe Classes must pass integration tests to ensure they function correctly within the system before being implemented.  

## Community Involvement:

**Voting:** The community votes on the proposed Vibe Classes. This Democratic process ensures that the Vibratile Credit System aligns with the collective interests of the users.     
**Feedback:** If a Vibe Class proves to be ineffective or problematic, the community can give Bad Vibes to the developer's contributions as a form of feedback, and accountability. 

## Types of Vibe Credits, and their potential examples of how Vibes can be credited:

## Randomized Vibe Credits

**Description:** A game-like mechanism that randomly selects users for Vibe Credits, providing an element of surprise.     
**Benefit:** Selected users receive an eternal boost for a month, giving them Good Vibes for the entire month.     
**Example:** User A gets Vibes randomly, but then enjoys a +50% Good Vibes for the next 30 days. User B gets Vibes randomly, but then is met with a -50% Bad Vibes for the next 30 days.     

## Behavior-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibe Credits are assigned based on a user's behavior, Good Vibes for Good Actors and Bad Vibes for Bad Actors.    
**Benefit:** Encourages positive contributions to the ecosystem.    
**Example:** Users flagged for rugpulls face Bad Vibes, while long-term holders receive Good Vibes.    

## Transaction Volume-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibe Credits vary based on the volume of transactions.    
**Benefit:** Higher transaction volumes incur Bad Vibes, promoting balanced trading activities.    
**Example:** Users transacting over 10,000 tokens in a single trade face an additional +20 Basis Point Bad Vibes.    

## Holding Duration-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibes are assigned based on the duration tokens are held.   
**Benefit:** Long-term holders are rewarded with Good Vibes.   
**Example:** Users holding tokens for more than a year receive +2 Basis Point Good Vibes per transaction.  

## Reputation-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibes are adjusted based on a user’s reputation within the community.    
**Benefit:** High-reputation users enjoy Good Vibes.    
**Example:** Users with a high-reputation score get +5 Basis Point Good Vibes on every transaction.   

## Integration and Verification

### Integration Tests:

**Purpose:** Ensure that each Vibe Class functions as intended within the overall system.    
**Process:** Developers must submit their Vibe Logic for integration testing. Only verified Vibe Classes that pass these tests are implemented.   

## Developer Accountability:

**Feedback Mechanism:** If a developer’s Vibe Class is poorly designed or implemented, the community can increase the developer's Bad Vibes as a form of feedback. Penalization using Bad Vibes to an extent, is virtually unlimited.
**Improvement:** This accountability mechanism encourages developers to create effective, and fair Vibe Logic.
