## Good Vibes and Bad Vibes

### What's my vibe?
Your Vibratile Credit is determined by the Vibe Classes in the protocol that calculates your Vibe. The community will vote on Vibe Classes that will determin if you are getting Good Vibes or Bad Vibes.

### Developer Role and Community Voting
## Developer's Responsibility:

**Vibe Logic Creation:** Developers design the Vibe Logic, deciding how and who gets Vibes. They can create complex or simple Vibe Credit mechanisms tailored to different scenarios.  
**Integration Testing:** All Vibe Classes must pass integration tests to ensure they function correctly within the system before being implemented.  

## Community Involvement:

**Voting:** The community votes on the proposed Vibe Classes. This Democratic process ensures that the Vibratile Credit System aligns with the collective interests of the users.     
**Feedback:** If a Vibe Class proves to be ineffective or problematic, the community can give Bad Vibes to the developer's contributions as a form of feedback and accountability. 

## Types of Vibe Credits
Here are some potential examples of how Vibes can be credited:

## Randomized Vibe Credits:

**Description:** A game-like mechanism that randomly selects users for Vibe Credits, providing an element of surprise.     
**Benefit:** Selected users receive an eternal boost for a month, giving them Good Vibes for the entire month.     
**Example:** User A gets Vibes randomly, but then enjoys a +50% Good Vibe for the next 30 days. User B gets Vibes randomly, but then is met with a -50% Bad Vibe for the next 30 days.     

## Behavior-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibe Credits are assigned based on a user's behavior, Good Vibes for good actors and Bad Vibes to bad actors.    
**Benefit:** Encourages positive contributions to the ecosystem.    
**Example:** Users flagged for rug pulls face Bad Vibes, while long-term holders receive Good Vibes.    

## Transaction Volume-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibe Credits vary based on the volume of transactions.    
**Benefit:** Higher transaction volumes incur Bad Vibes, promoting balanced trading activities.    
**Example:** Users transacting over 10,000 tokens in a single trade face an additional 20 Basis Point Bad Vibe.    

## Holding Duration-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibes are assigned based on the duration tokens are held.   
**Benefit:** Long-term holders are rewarded with Good Vibes.   
**Example:** Users holding tokens for more than a year receive a 10 Basis Point Good Vibe.   

## Reputation-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Vibes are adjusted based on a user’s reputation within the community.    
**Benefit:** High-reputation users enjoy Good Vibes.    
**Example:** Users with a high-reputation score get a 5 Basis Point Good Vibe on every transaction.   

## Integration and Verification

### Integration Tests:

**Purpose:** Ensure that each Vibe Class functions as intended within the overall system.    
**Process:** Developers must submit their Vibe Logic for integration testing. Only verified Vibe Classes that pass these tests are implemented.   

## Developer Accountability:

**Feedback Mechanism:** If a developer’s Vibe Class is poorly designed or implemented, the community can increase the developer's Bad Vibes as a form of feedback. Penalization using Bad Vibes to an extent, is virtually unlimited.
**Improvement:** This accountability mechanism encourages developers to create effective and fair Vibe Logic.
