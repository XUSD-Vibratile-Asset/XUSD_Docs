description: 
---

**Definition:**
Tax classes are distinct categories of taxation determined by the community, each with specific rules and basis points. These classes help tailor the tax rates to various behaviors and transaction types within the Vibratile token ecosystem.

## Community-Determined Tax Classes
**Community Involvement:**
The community plays a crucial role in defining and approving tax classes. This decentralized approach ensures that the tax system aligns with the collective interests and goals of the community.

### Active Tax Classes:
A publicly accessible page will display a running list of all currently active tax classes. This transparency allows users to understand how their taxes are being calculated and observe the impact on their positions.

### Types of Tax Classes
The community can create a variety of tax classes to address different scenarios and user behaviors. Here are some potential examples:

#### 1. Transaction Volume-Based Tax:

**Description:** Taxes users based on the volume of their transactions.  
**Basis Points:** Higher basis points for larger transactions, lower for smaller ones.  
**Example:** Users transacting over 1,000 tokens may incur an additional 50 basis points.  

#### 2. Holding Duration-Based Tax:

**Description:** Rewards users who hold their tokens for longer periods.  
**Basis Points:** Negative basis points for long-term holders, positive for short-term.  
**Example:** Users holding tokens for over a year receive a 20 basis point reduction.  

#### 3. Reputation-Based Tax:

**Description:** Adjusts taxes based on a userâ€™s reputation within the community.  
**Basis Points:** Negative basis points for high-reputation users, positive for low-reputation.  
**Example:** Users with a high reputation score get a 10 basis point tax reduction.  

#### 4. Behavior-Based Tax:

**Description:** Penalizes users for negative behaviors such as frequent rug pulls.  
**Basis Points:** High positive basis points for identified bad actors.  
**Example:** Users flagged for rug pulls incur an additional 100 basis points.  

#### 5. Special Event-Based Tax:

**Description:** Applied during specific events or conditions within the ecosystem.  
**Basis Points:** Variable based on the event.  
**Example:** During a new token launch, a temporary 30 basis point tax is applied.
