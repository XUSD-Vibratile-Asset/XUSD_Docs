## Who gets taxed?

This is soley on teh developer to decide and the people to vote in. It can be crazy like a randomly chosen game that taxes you or anyone else without warning without your prior knowledge, but then also gives them an ethernal boost for a month afterwards reducing the taxes the entire month. 
Or they can be simple. But they all must be verified and pass the integration test to be included into the peroject. If the dev did a bad job, let him know it by increasing his takes.
