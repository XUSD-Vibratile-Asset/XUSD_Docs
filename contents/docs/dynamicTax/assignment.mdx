### Who Gets Taxed?
Tax assignment in the Vibratile token ecosystem is determined by the developers and approved by community votes. The flexibility of this system allows for a wide range of creative and simple tax assignment strategies.

### Developer Role and Community Voting
## Developer's Responsibility:

**Tax Logic Creation:** Developers design the tax logic, deciding how and who gets taxed. They can create complex or simple tax mechanisms tailored to different scenarios.  
**Integration Testing:** All tax classes must pass integration tests to ensure they function correctly within the system before being implemented.  

## Community Involvement:

**Voting:** The community votes on the proposed tax classes. This democratic process ensures that the tax system aligns with the collective interests of the users.     
**Feedback:** If a tax class proves to be ineffective or problematic, the community can increase taxes on the developer's contributions as a form of feedback and accountability. 

## Types of Tax Assignment
Here are some potential examples of how taxes can be assigned:

## Randomized Tax Assignment:

**Description:** A game-like mechanism that randomly selects users for taxation, providing an element of surprise.     
**Benefit:** Selected users receive an eternal boost for a month, reducing their taxes for the entire month.     
**Example:** User A gets taxed randomly but then enjoys a 50% tax reduction for the next 30 days.     

## Behavior-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Taxes are assigned based on user behavior, rewarding good actors and penalizing bad actors.    
**Benefit:** Encourages positive contributions to the ecosystem.    
**Example:** Users flagged for rug pulls face higher taxes, while long-term holders receive tax reductions.    

## Transaction Volume-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Taxes vary based on the volume of transactions.    
**Benefit:** Higher transaction volumes incur higher taxes, promoting balanced trading activities.    
**Example:** Users transacting over 10,000 tokens in a single trade face an additional 20 basis points tax.    

## Holding Duration-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Taxes are assigned based on the duration tokens are held.   
**Benefit:** Long-term holders are rewarded with lower taxes.   
**Example:** Users holding tokens for more than a year receive a 10 basis point tax reduction.   

## Reputation-Based Assignment:

**Description:** Taxes are adjusted based on a user’s reputation within the community.    
**Benefit:** High-reputation users enjoy tax benefits.    
**Example:** Users with a high reputation score get a 5 basis point reduction on every transaction.   

## Integration and Verification

### Integration Tests:

**Purpose:** Ensure that each tax class functions as intended within the overall system.    
**Process:** Developers must submit their tax logic for integration testing. Only verified tax classes that pass these tests are implemented.   

## Developer Accountability:

**Feedback Mechanism:** If a developer’s tax class is poorly designed or implemented, the community can increase the developer's taxes as a form of feedback.    
**Improvement:** This accountability mechanism encourages developers to create effective and fair tax logic.
