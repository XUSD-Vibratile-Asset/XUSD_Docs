## Basis Points

Every single tax class in the system uses basis points to determin the tax. And those basis points are easily retrevable on each individual contract as to not get them lost or confused.

There will be use of both a negative basis points and positive. Negative will decrease your taxes while positive will increase it. 

As of now, 70% of all taxes are burned in the same transaction as they were taken in. The other 30% will be stored and used for overcolateralized debt positions. 
These are sublect to chainge and more then likily will favore even more burning.
