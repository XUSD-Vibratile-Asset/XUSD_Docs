title: Basis Points in Dynamic Taxation
description: 
---

**Definition:**
Basis points (bps) are a unit of measure used in finance to describe percentage changes or rate changes. One basis point is equal to 0.01%. In the context of dynamic taxation for Vibratile tokens, basis points are used to determine the tax rate for each tax class.

## Tax Calculation Using Basis Points
**Tax Class Basis Points:**
Every tax class in the system uses basis points to determine the tax rate. These basis points are easily retrievable on each individual contract to avoid confusion or misplacement.

**Negative and Positive Basis Points:**

**Negative Basis Points:** These decrease the tax rate for the user. They act as incentives or rewards for positive behavior or contributions to the ecosystem.
**Positive Basis Points:** These increase the tax rate for the user, penalizing negative behavior or actions that harm the community.


**Tax Distribution**
**Burning Mechanism:**

70% of All Taxes Burned: Currently, 70% of all collected taxes are burned in the same transaction in which they were collected. This immediate reduction in the token supply helps to maintain the price stability of Vibratile tokens like XUSD.
30% for Collateralized Debt Positions: The remaining 30% of collected taxes are stored and used for overcollateralized debt positions. These funds act as a financial buffer and can be adjusted as needed. The allocation might be subject to change, with a potential shift towards even more burning to further stabilize the token price.
