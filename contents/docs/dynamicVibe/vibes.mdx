**Good Vibes and Bad Vibes:**

**Good Vibes:** These decrease the vibratile credit for the user. They act as incentives or rewards for positive behavior or contributions to the ecosystem.
**Bad Vibes:** These increase the vibratile credit rate for the user, penalizing negative behavior or actions that harm the community.


**Vibe Distribution**
**Burning Mechanism:**

70% of All vibe credits are Burned: Currently, 70% of all collected vibe credits are burned in the same transaction in which they were collected. This immediate reduction in the token supply helps to maintain the price stability of Vibratile tokens like XUSD.
30% for Collateralized Debt Positions: The remaining 30% of collected vibe credits are stored and used for overcollateralized debt positions. These funds act as a financial buffer and can be adjusted as needed. The allocation might be subject to change, with a potential shift towards even more burning to further stabilize the token price.
