### Who Gets Vibratile credits?
Vibe Credits are determined by the developers and approved by community votes. The flexibility of this system allows for a wide range of creative and simple vibe credit strategies.

### Developer Role and Community Voting
## Developer's Responsibility:

**Vibe Logic Creation:** Developers design the vibe logic, deciding how and who gets vibed. They can create complex or simple vibe credit mechanisms tailored to different scenarios.  
**Integration Testing:** All vibe classes must pass integration tests to ensure they function correctly within the system before being implemented.  

## Community Involvement:

**Voting:** The community votes on the proposed vibe classes. This democratic process ensures that the vibratile credit system aligns with the collective interests of the users.     
**Feedback:** If a vibe class proves to be ineffective or problematic, the community can give bad vibes to the developer's contributions as a form of feedback and accountability. 

## Types of Vibe Credits
Here are some potential examples of how vibes can be credited:

## Randomized Vibe Credits:

**Description:** A game-like mechanism that randomly selects users for vibe credits, providing an element of surprise.     
**Benefit:** Selected users receive an eternal boost for a month, giving them good vibes for the entire month.     
**Example:** User A gets vibed randomly but then enjoys a 50% good vibe for the next 30 days.     

## Behavior-Based Assignment:

**Description:** vibe credits are assigned based on user behavior, good vibes for good actors and bad vibes to bad actors.    
**Benefit:** Encourages positive contributions to the ecosystem.    
**Example:** Users flagged for rug pulls face bad vibes, while long-term holders receive good vibes.    

## Transaction Volume-Based Assignment:

**Description:** vibe credits vary based on the volume of transactions.    
**Benefit:** Higher transaction volumes incur bad vibes, promoting balanced trading activities.    
**Example:** Users transacting over 10,000 tokens in a single trade face an additional 20 basis points bad vibe.    

## Holding Duration-Based Assignment:

**Description:** vibes are assigned based on the duration tokens are held.   
**Benefit:** Long-term holders are rewarded with good vibes.   
**Example:** Users holding tokens for more than a year receive a 10 basis point good vibe.   

## Reputation-Based Assignment:

**Description:** vibes are adjusted based on a user’s reputation within the community.    
**Benefit:** High-reputation users enjoy good vibes.    
**Example:** Users with a high reputation score get a 5 basis point good vibe on every transaction.   

## Integration and Verification

### Integration Tests:

**Purpose:** Ensure that each vibe class functions as intended within the overall system.    
**Process:** Developers must submit their vibe logic for integration testing. Only verified vibe classes that pass these tests are implemented.   

## Developer Accountability:

**Feedback Mechanism:** If a developer’s vibe class is poorly designed or implemented, the community can increase the developer's bad vibes as a form of feedback.    
**Improvement:** This accountability mechanism encourages developers to create effective and fair vibe logic.
