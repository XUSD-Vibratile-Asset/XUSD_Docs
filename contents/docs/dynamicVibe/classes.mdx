description: 
---

**Definition:**
Vibe Classes are distinct categories of Vibes determined by the community, each with specific rules and Basis Points. These classes help tailor the Vibratile Credits to various behaviors and transaction types within the Vibratile token ecosystem.

## Community-Determined Vibe Classes
**Community Involvement:**
The community plays a crucial role in defining, and approving Vibe Classes. This decentralized approach ensures that the Vibratile Credit System aligns with the collective interests, and goals of the community.

### Active Vibe Classes:
A publicly accessible page will display a running list of all currently Active Vibes. This transparency allows users to understand how their Vibratile Credits are being calculated, and to observe the impact on their positions.

### Types of Vibe Classes
The community can create a variety of Vibe Classes to address different scenarios, and user behaviors. In the end, they will all be categorized. Here are some potential examples:

#### 1. Transaction Volume-Based Vibe:

**Description:** Vibe users based on the volume of their transactions.  
**Basis Points:** Higher basis points for larger transactions, lower for smaller ones.  
**Example:** Users transacting over 1,000 tokens may incur an additional +50 Bad Vibes.  

#### 2. Holding Duration-Based Vibe:

**Description:** Rewards users who hold their tokens for longer periods.  
**Basis Points:** Negative Basis Points for long-term holders, positive for short-term.  
**Example:** Users holding tokens for over a year receive +2 Basis Point Good Vibes per transaction.  

#### 3. Reputation-Based Vibe:

**Description:** Adjusts Vibes based on a userâ€™s reputation within the community.  
**Basis Points:** Negative Basis Points for high-reputation users, positive for low-reputation.  
**Example:** Users with a high reputation score get +10 Basis Point Good Vibes per transaction.

#### 4. Behavior-Based Vibe:

**Description:** Penalizes users for negative behaviors, such as frequent rugpulls.  
**Basis Points:** High-positive Basis Points for identified Bad Actors.  
**Example:** Users flagged for rugpulls incur an additional +100 Bad Vibes.  

#### 5. Special Event-Based Vibe:

**Description:** Applied during specific events, or conditions within the ecosystem.  
**Basis Points:** Variable based on the event.  
**Example:** During a new token launch, a temporary 30 Bad Vibes are applied, but can later reward the token deployer with a one-time payment of +250 Good Vibes if the token acts benevolenty towards the XUSD protocol.
