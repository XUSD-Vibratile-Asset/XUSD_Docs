## 💡 **What are the Benefits of Owning a VibePass?**

- Every VibePass holder starts with **500 Good Vibes**. To purchase a VibePass, you need a minimum of **400 Good Vibes**.  
- This promotes the decentralization of the protocol while maintaining the integrity of the project during its early stages.  
- **30% of all 1SWAP tokens** received will be burned, while the remaining **70%** will go toward team allocations and protocol-owned liquidity.  

### Early Ownership Benefits:
Owning a VibePass early, especially during the **XUSD Genesis phase**, allows you to start earning **Good Vibes** immediately. This early advantage means your rewards will be **exponentially greater** once the XUSD peg is reached.

## 📈 **VibePass Pricing Scale**

The price of a VibePass will decrease **linearly** over the course of a year. If you can’t afford one now, don’t worry. The price will eventually drop to a bottom value of **10,000 1SWAP tokens**.

### 🗝️ **Key Takeaway**:  
Purchasing a VibePass early grants you access to more benefits compared to those who wait. **The sooner you act, the greater your rewards.**

## 🔑 **Personal Team Recommendation**

We highly recommend securing a **VibePass** sooner rather than later.  
- A VibePass is your key to financial freedom, combining **scalability** and **decentralization** in a frictionless way.  
- It opens the door to a **decentralized banking experience** that aligns with investor needs.

## 💎 **Comparing VibePass to HEX T-Shares**

Think of the **VibePass** like a **HEX T-share**. The goal is to accumulate as many shares as early as possible for maximum long-term benefits.  
- While HEX T-shares are time-locked, **XUSD** rewards its VibePass holders once the peg is reached, preventing the risk of a **mass sell-off**.
- The longer you hold, the more rewarding it becomes—**delayed gratification** at its finest.

### 🚀 **Why Delayed Gratification is Revolutionary**

We believe the **XUSD Vibratile Asset** will play a pivotal role in sparking the next **PulseChain bull cycle**, as it unites communities and promotes healthy market behavior. Bad actors are penalized, and good actors are rewarded, fostering a positive ecosystem.

---

## 🐋 **How Many VibePasses Can a Wallet Hold?**

Each wallet is limited to owning **one VibePass**.  
- If you're a whale in the ecosystem and wish to hold more than one VibePass (for greater yield and voting power), you'll need to create multiple wallets.
