## üåê What is a Vibratile Token?

**Vibratile**: *Capable of or characterized by oscillatory motion.*

A **Vibratile token** is a digital asset designed to fluctuate around a target price by moving above and below it. Unlike stablecoins, which are meant to maintain a fixed value, Vibratile tokens embrace volatility to achieve long-term price stability.  
For example, the **XUSD token** oscillates around the target price of 1 USD. However, it should not be mistaken for a stablecoin as it relies on different mechanics for price regulation.

## üß† Conceptual Analogy

> Imagine a loose, dangling rope bridge that you need to tighten to cross. To raise the bridge, you shorten the rope. If it becomes too high, you add more rope to lower it.  
Similarly, **XUSD** adjusts its supply by **burning tokens** on every transaction, like shortening the rope to increase the price. When the price rises too high, the supply is **inflated** to bring it back down.

## üîç Differences from Stablecoins

While stablecoins maintain their value by being tied to collateral, **Vibratile tokens** like **XUSD** rely on algorithms and community-driven mechanics.  
Here‚Äôs how they differ:

- **Stablecoins**: Maintain a steady value, often backed by reserves (e.g., **USDC** with a 1:1 USD reserve).
- **Vibratile Tokens**: Use supply adjustments through **contraction** and **inflation** mechanisms, supported by community trust and involvement, rather than reserves.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanisms of XUSD

### üìâ Contraction

**Contraction** refers to reducing the token supply to increase its value. **XUSD** employs a **burning mechanism** to achieve this, where tokens are permanently removed from circulation. Here‚Äôs how XUSD contracts its supply:

- **Dynamic Taxes**: 70% of all transaction taxes are burned, while the remaining 30% is used for bonds.
- As the transaction volume grows, so does the burn, ensuring continuous contraction of the supply.
- **User Contributions**: Users who help burn tokens are credited for their contributions.

### üìà Inflation

When demand for XUSD exceeds the token supply, **inflation** is necessary to stabilize the price. Here's how inflation works within XUSD:

- **Burning Tokens**: XUSD burns tokens on every transaction, eventually reducing the supply to the point where demand surpasses the target price.
- **Inflation as a Tool**: Inflation is not viewed negatively in this context but as a tool for economic growth and price stability.
- **Stakeholder Rewards**: Inflationary rewards are distributed to key stakeholders (referred to as "kings"), who can use these rewards to help adjust the price of XUSD.

- **Inflation Rate**: The rate of inflation is determined by the **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** and is adjusted periodically based on the market conditions.

## ü§ù Importance of Community Trust

The value of a **Vibratile token** like **XUSD** is deeply tied to the trust and perceived value within its community. Trust plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and growth of Vibratile tokens. Future sections will delve deeper into how community involvement strengthens this system.
