This section will help you get started with the necessary steps and materials to engage with PulseChain, and utilize Vibratile Tokens such as XUSD effectively.


## PulseChain

To get connected to the PulseChain, check out the [Get Started PulseChain](PulseChain).

## Stake Assigned Tokens Chosen For Genesis Phase Pools 
1. **(PLS, PLSX, INC, eHEX, pHEX, pDAI, Atropa, 1SWAP, wONE, LOVE.IO, BFF, AFFECTION™, NBA™, Teddybear㉾, A1A, Finvesta, FKO, FRENS, DEX, TEVE, NAZA, LEMON and SIMP.)**
2. **Buy Any Assigned Token Above**: Ensure you have a sufficient amount of that token to stake and receive your staking rewards in XUSD.
3. **Approve contract**: Approve the staking contract to use your token for deposits.
4. **Stake Assigned Token**: Stake your token to start generating XUSD rewards.
5. **Earn**: Watch your XUSD grow as the rewards accumulate!


## Withdraw Assigned Token

Once the Genesis Phase is over, you can withdraw your staked tokens and **create liquidity.** (There is no time-lock.)

1. **Un-stake Your tokens**: Withdraw your tokens from the contract into your wallet.
2. **Create Liquidity**: Use the acquired XUSD and a token of your choice to create liquidity for the next farms.
3. **Stake Into A Farm**: Approve the contract to use the LP token, stake into the contract, and receive OneSwap rewards.
4. **Earn**: Continue earning rewards from the liquidity you provided.




## Participate within the community

Stay informed about the protocol launch sequence. Active participation within the communities on social media ensures you are up to date with the developments of the protocol. We are looking forward to having you on board in our Telegram channel and Twitter/X. You can find the links on the frontpage of the XUSD website.



## How do you buy XUSD outside of Genesis Staking?

You will be able to trade the pairs on multiple PulseChain DEXes such as PulseX V2, Piteas and others. Keep in mind, in a Vibratile token system, there are associated taxes. You can find more information on those in particular to XUSD in the [Dynamic Vibratile Credit](DynamicVibeOverview).



## Why do we recommend XUSD?

Farming the XUSD token represents a prudent investment decision, as it heralds a new era of technological innovation within the PulseChain ecosystem. Furthermore, it incentivizes the community to engage in ethical and responsible practices on the way reaching the peg.
