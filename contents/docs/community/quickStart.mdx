Stay informed about the protocol launch sequence. Active participation within the communities on social media ensures you are up to date with the developments of the protocol. We are looking forward to having you on board in our Telegram channel and Twitter/X. You can find the links on the frontpage of the XUSD website.



## How to buy XUSD outside of Genesis staking?

You will be able to trade the pairs on multiple PulseChain DEXes such as PulseX V2, Piteas and others. Keep in mind, in a vibratile token system, there are associated taxes. You can find more information on those in particular to XUSD in the [Overview](Dynamic Vibratile Credits).



## Why do we recommend XUSD?

Buying the XUSD token is a solid choice, because it offers an entire new era of technological advancement within the PulseChain ecosystem and teaches investors how to act accordingly and in a benevolent manner.
