## LP farming rewards

Bootstapping will begin within the first few hours of launch. OneSwap will be used as rewards for the Bootstrapping phase and it will be running alongside the extended Genesis. There will be an aditional 40,000,000 1SWAP tokens available in the Bootstrapping farms. The main farms will be 1SWAP/XUSD and LOVE/XUSD. PLS/XUSD, HEX/XUSD and PLSX/XUSD farms will be added in the near future. We are open to consider adding more pairs in the future. These farms are meant for users to make liquidity pairs, and earn enough 1SWAP to be able to purchase a VibePass via farming.

## XUSD will start with ZERO liquidity

**DO NOT** buy XUSD with WPLS. You will lose all your money because it will go down. There is no liquidity yet, and we don't plan to add any until the time is right.
The XUSD Vibratile Asset is **built to start high and return to zero.** We project XUSD to bottom out **somewhere between $0.00008 and $0.00018**, which is where the real game starts. **More liquidity will be added later.** You can however use the consolidated XUSD Trading panel to **swap 1SWAP or LOVE tokens at a premium.** Tod do that, you can copy the following steps:

### Trading steps
1. Go to **https://www.x-usd.net/Trading.**
2. Click on **any of the Rewards Periods.**
3. Choose either **1SWAP or LOVE** tokens to swap into XUSD.

## When do we recommend buying XUSD with Genesis tokens?

You may accumulate whenever you want. You are free to transact, but when XUSD drops down a couple more zeroes, that is where you should be swapping your tokens into XUSD for the most profit later on.

## What is XUSD's end goal?

The end goal is to **help XUSD pull back up to $1, **stabilise and oscilate around that price point.** VibePass holders will begin earning XUSD emissions and the bonus Good Vibes through the burning of XUSD on every transactions at $1. You can find more information on Vibes and the VibePass in the [XUSD VibePass](https://docs.x-usd.net/docs/VibePass/Obtain).

**That is many Thousands of X's on your investment against XUSD.**

There will be a total of around **1,000,000,000 XUSD** emitted within the next 25 weeks. More information can be found in the [Launch Stages](https://docs.x-usd.net/docs/Launch/Genesis).
