# XUSD Bootstrapping

## Status

The bootstrapping phase for XUSD is now live! You can participate by visiting the [Farms section](https://www.x-usd.net/Farms) on the XUSD website.

## How to Participate

### Farming

You can pair your **Love** and **1SWAP** tokens with XUSD to provide liquidity and stake in the farms. By doing so, you'll start earning **1SWAP tokens**, which are necessary for purchasing a **VibePass**.

If you are a potential partner interested in adding more pairs to the farms, we are open to collaboration. Feel free to contact us on [Telegram](#).

The farms will remain active for one year, starting from the launch date: **September 24, 2024**.

### Liquidity Disclaimer

Currently, the primary liquidity within the XUSD ecosystem is concentrated in the **1SWAP** and **LOVE** token pairs.

## How to Trade XUSD

Follow these steps to trade XUSD:

1. Visit the [Trading section](https://www.x-usd.net/Trading) of the XUSD website.
2. Select any active Rewards Period.
3. Choose **1SWAP** or **LOVE** tokens to swap for XUSD.

## XUSD End Goal

The ultimate aim of XUSD is to achieve price stability around $1. **VibePass holders** will earn XUSD emissions, along with bonus **Good Vibes**, through the burning of XUSD on every transaction once the token stabilizes at $1.

For more details on VibePass, visit the [XUSD VibePass page](https://docs.x-usd.net/docs/VibePass/Obtain).

### Emissions

XUSD will emit approximately **1 billion tokens** during the first 25 weeks after launch. You can explore more details in the [Launch Stages section](https://docs.x-usd.net/docs/Launch/Genesis).
