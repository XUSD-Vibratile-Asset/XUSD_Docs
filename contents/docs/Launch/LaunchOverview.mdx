**Duration:** 1 year

- In this phase, liquidity farming for the **OneSwap token** will take place. Participants can provide liquidity in exchange for rewards, helping to stabilize the ecosystem and ensure there is sufficient liquidity across the platform. 

- Somewhere midway of the Bootstrapping phase, the minting function will be renounced. Minting protocol will get audited and deployed. It is necessary to maintain the minting function beforehand to manage inflation accordingly to assist the token in reaching 1$, especially while the Genesis farms are still active.
