# Launch Sequence

## Protocol Launch Phases

### 1. Genesis Phase  
**Duration:** Up to 25 weeks

During the Genesis phase, approximately **40,000,000 XUSD tokens** will be distributed weekly.  
- **1/8** of the total supply is allocated to the staking pool.  
- The remaining portion is dedicated to the **trading rewards module**. 

This phase is crucial for initial distribution and community engagement, setting the stage for the future growth of the XUSD ecosystem.

### 2. Bootstrapping Phase  
**Duration:** 1 year

In this phase, liquidity farming for the **OneSwap token** will take place. Participants can provide liquidity in exchange for rewards, further stabilizing the ecosystem and ensuring sufficient liquidity across the platform.

### 3. Operational Phase  
**Duration:** Ongoing

At the conclusion of the Bootstrapping phase, the control and governance of the **XUSD Vibratile Asset Protocol** will be transitioned to one of the following:
- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Allowing for community-driven decision-making and governance.
- **Another Community**: Empowering a dedicated group to continue the protocol's operations.

This phase marks the sustainable, long-term operation of the XUSD protocol, with governance placed firmly in the hands of the community or a decentralized body.
