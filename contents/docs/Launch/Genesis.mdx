# Genesis Phase Overview

## Genesis Staking: 1/8 of XUSD Disbursement

### Eligible Tokens for Staking:
- **PLS, PLSX, INC, eHEX, pHEX, pDAI, Atropa, 1SWAP, LOVE.IO, BFF, AFFECTION™, NBA™, Teddybear㉾, A1A, Finvesta, FKO, FRENS, DEX, LEMON, and SIMP.**

### How to Stake:
1. **Purchase Assigned Tokens**: Ensure you have enough of the eligible tokens to stake and earn XUSD.
2. **Approve Contract**: Authorize the staking contract to access your tokens.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Deposit the selected tokens to begin earning XUSD rewards.
4. **Earn XUSD**: Accumulate XUSD as rewards are distributed over time.

## Genesis Trading: 7/8 of XUSD Disbursement

We are seeking the support of community leaders to participate by submitting a **Community Wallet**. This wallet will be whitelisted, allowing access to create LP tokens paired with XUSD. Community members transacting on these LP pairs will be eligible to receive XUSD rewards if they maintain a high enough **Vibe Score**.

To earn the right to whitelist LP tokens, participants must achieve a **Vibe Ranking** of **300** or lower.

### How Genesis Trading Works:

**Example**:  
If XUSD is paired with **SIMP**, any trades between XUSD and SIMP using that LP token will be eligible for rewards. To qualify, you need a **Vibe Score** of **450** or lower. Reward distributions and thresholds will be randomized. However, note the following rules:
- The lower your **Vibe Score**, the higher your reward potential.
- Buying XUSD will yield more rewards, while selling will result in fewer rewards.
- Trade size also factors into the reward calculation.

## Daily Rewards Limit

Each LP pair will be capped at **250,000 tokens per epoch**, with a total **epoch cap of 1,500,000 tokens** across all tradeable pairs. During the first week, fewer tokens will be available, but as more LP tokens become available, the limits will increase.

Additionally, each user is capped at **2,500 XUSD per epoch** per LP pair. These limits are subject to adjustment to ensure fair distribution.

The Genesis phase is designed to distribute XUSD tokens to the community ahead of the project’s official launch. Community leaders are encouraged to whitelist LP tokens created with XUSD or even launch new tokens. **This creates an opportunity for communities to grow while benefiting from our marketing reach.** Together, we can achieve exponential growth during the upcoming bull market.

### Duration of Genesis Phase

The Genesis phase will run for a maximum of **25 weeks**, although this duration may change depending on the progress of the project. With no prior Genesis model like this, the timeline will be flexible. Once the token supply is deemed sufficient for sustainable growth, the protocol will transition to its next phase.

The initial supply will be capped at **1 billion tokens**, with **40 million tokens** distributed weekly. Upon reaching the $1 peg, this will equate to **$40 million in weekly distributions**.

### Whitelisting LP Tokens

To whitelist an LP token, you must achieve a **Vibe Score** of **300 or lower**, or you can contact **Surfacing8671** for assistance. Leaders who successfully whitelist their community tokens will be granted the rank of **LEGATUS**, the first major role within the XUSD ecosystem. This role carries a voting weight of **2 points**, double that of a regular community member.

The **LEGATUS** rank also provides special permissions at the contract level, enabling leaders to add LP tokens independently and bring millions of XUSD to their community. A dedicated page for LP token whitelisting will be made available for leaders. More information about the LEGATUS role can be found in the [Praetorship documentation](https://xusd-docs.vercel.app/docs/PraetorshipDev/PraetorshipDev).

### Qualification Criteria

To participate, you must obtain **50 Good Vibes** by depositing any token into the Genesis staking contract. If you unstake, you will regain **50 Bad Vibes**.
