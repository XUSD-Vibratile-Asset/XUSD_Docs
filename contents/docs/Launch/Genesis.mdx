## Genesis Staking - 1/8 of XUSD Disbursement 

### Genesis Phase Tokens go as: (PLS, PLSX, INC, eHEX, pHEX, pDAI, Atropa, 1SWAP, wONE, LOVE.IO, BFF, AFFECTION™, NBA™, Teddybear㉾, A1A, Finvesta, FKO, FRENS, DEX, LEMON and SIMP.)
1. **Buy Any Assigned Token Above**: Ensure you have enough of that token to stake and receive XUSD tokens.
2. **Approve contract**: Approve the staking contract to use your token for deposits.
3. **Stake Assigned Token**:  Stake your token to start generating XUSD rewards.
4. **Earn**: Watch your XUSD grow as the rewards accumulate!

## Genesis Trading - 7/8 of XUSD Disbursement 

We need help from fellow community leaders to step forward, and to participate. It is vital they attain a rank-up by submitting a Community Wallet. This Community Wallet will have access to whitelisting LP tokens that they create with XUSD. Traders transacting on those whitelisted pairs will then be able to recieve XUSD rewards IF they have a good enough Vibe.
You can also obtain the rank to list LP tokens yourself, you just need a Vibe Ranking of 300 or less. 

## How Genesis Trading Works

## **Example:**
We have XUSD, and it is paired with SIMP for example. Any trades between the XUSD and SIMP via that LP token will be eligible to receive rewards. To qualify for the rewards, you must have a vibe of 450 or less. The amount of rewards and additional amount threshholds are going to be randomized. 
There are a few rules tho, the lower your vibe the more you will make and if you will also make more while buying xusd and less when you sell it. Also the amount of your trade will figure into the math as well. 

## Daily Rewards Limit

There will be a cap of 250,000 tokens available fer LP token per epoch. There is also an epoch cap of 1,500,000 tokens an epoch across all of the tradeable pairs. The first week will start off smaller then this (total available XUSD) and then get to the desired amounts once there are more LP tokens available.
And also each user will be capped at about 2,500 XUSD per epoch per LP pair. These values are adjustable as we want to make sure that the XUSD is being distributed correctly. The genesis phase is meant to be a distribution to the community before the project actually fully starts.
We also decided this unique approach because individual community leaders will be able to whitelist there token lp as long as it is made with XUSD or they could launch a new token as well! **This gives your individual communities a great opportunity to grow** Use our marketing and reach to strengthen your communities. When 
you all grow, we all grow together and we are primed to grow exponentially this upcomming bull run.   

### How long will it last? 
Genesis will run for a maximum of **25 weeks**. We say maximum because we will play it by ear as time goes on. No body has ever done this kind of genesis before and its just the begining of the project itself. Once the supply looks effecient for amazing growth we will transition into the next phase of the protocol. 
This also means that we will have a max initial supply or around 1 billion tokens. Thats 40 million tokens a week. When we get to peg that is the equivelent of giving out 40 million a week!

### How do you whitelist an LP token?

You must obtain a Vibe of at least 300, or you can talk to Surfacing8671 about being able to whitelist your community token. This is a huge deal. Leaders who step up will be granted the rank of LEGATUS. This is the first major role in our ecosystem, and has a weighed vote of 2 points. That is twice that of any normal member of XUSD. 
This project is heavily focused on both the community, and teamwork. The rank of LEGATUS will grant you special permissions on the contract level, so that you can add the token LP all by yourself to get those Millions of XUSD to your community. There will be a special page for leaders to add LP tokens. You can read more about the LEGATUS rank in the [Praetorship](https://xusd-docs.vercel.app/docs/PraetorshipDev/PraetorshipDev).

### How do you qualify? 
You can easily obtain the 50 Good Vibes to participate by depositing any token into the Genesis staking contract. If you unstake, you regain those 50 Bad Vibes.
