## üîÑ Genesis Trading: 7/8 of XUSD Disbursement

We encourage community leaders to submit a **Community Wallet**, which can be whitelisted to create LP tokens paired with XUSD. Community members trading on these LP pairs will be eligible for XUSD rewards if they maintain a high **Vibe Score**.

### üìú How Genesis Trading Works:

**Example:**  
If XUSD is paired with **SIMP**, any trades between XUSD and SIMP using that LP token will be eligible for rewards. To qualify, you need a **Vibe Score** of **450** or lower. Here are the rules:
- The **lower your Vibe Score**, the higher your reward potential.
- **Buying XUSD** yields more rewards, while **selling** results in fewer rewards.
- The **trade size** also factors into the reward calculation.

## üéØ Daily Rewards Limit

Each LP pair will be capped at **250,000 tokens per epoch**, with a total **epoch cap of 1,500,000 tokens** across all tradeable pairs. Initially, fewer tokens will be available, but limits will increase as more LP tokens are added.

Each user is capped at **2,500 XUSD per epoch per LP pair**. These limits may be adjusted to ensure fair distribution.

### üîç Key Benefits:
- **Community Growth:** Leaders are encouraged to whitelist LP tokens with XUSD or launch new tokens. This is a great opportunity to grow your community while benefiting from our marketing reach.
- **Mutual Success:** When individual communities grow, we all grow together.
